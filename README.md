# Traveling salesman problem
Here implementation of simple greedy algorithm for this problem, it doesn't give you optimal solution, but it's polynomial and much faster than then just brute force approach, solution near 20-30% worse then optimal.

# Input file format
First line - number of cities(N)<br>
Next N lines - coordinates of cities(x y) on 2D Cartesian coordinate system
<br>
# Output file format
First line - minimum lenght of route that algorithm found<br>
Second line - numbers of cities in order of its arrangement in input file
